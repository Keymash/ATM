# ATM
Simulates an ATM, withdrawels and bank fees.
Only accepts multiples of 20 or 50, not combinations.
Handling for insufficient balance, incorrect withdraw amount and fees.

What I learned:
Converting data types from one to another (string -> float -> string)
Forcing decimal places (I.e. $2.50 instead of $2.5)
